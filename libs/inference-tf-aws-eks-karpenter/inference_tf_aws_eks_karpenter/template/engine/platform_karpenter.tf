# destroy the controller release next, killing the only thing that drains those
# nodes → orphaned EC2/EBS/ENIs → VPC won't delete → jd down hangs.

#   - NodePool release depends_on THIS  → on destroy, NodePools deleted first,
#     then this poller runs.
#   - THIS references (as real attributes, in triggers) the controller release,
#     the cluster name/endpoint, and the admin access entry → all torn down AFTER
#     the poller. So Karpenter is alive to reconcile, the API is reachable, and
